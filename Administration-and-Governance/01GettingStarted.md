# Power Platform Workshop: Administration and Governance

### Overall Estimated Duration: 8 Hours

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will step into the role of a Power Platform administrator for Fabrikam and Contoso, gaining end-to-end experience in governance, monitoring, and deployment. You’ll begin by inventorying existing Power Apps and flows, then leverage the Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit to track usage and enforce data policies. Next, you’ll build a Microsoft Form–based request workflow with Power Automate approvals to provision new environments and Dataverse databases on demand. You’ll explore managed environments and pipelines to promote solutions from development through test and production stages. Finally, you’ll practice app auditing and learn how to create and publish a Power App within Microsoft Teams, extending it both inside and outside your team.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Securing your Tenant**: In this hands-on lab, participants will assume the role of a Power Platform environment administrator for Fabrikam, discover and inventory existing Power Apps and flows in their tenant, and establish baseline data loss prevention and security policies. They will configure administrative connectors and governance tools to enforce these policies, ensuring users can continue building productive solutions while adhering to Fabrikam’s compliance requirements.

- **Reporting and Telemetry**: In this hands-on lab, participants will gain hands‑on experience as Power Platform administrators by inventorying existing Power Apps, flows, and environments across their tenant using the CoE Starter Kit. They will configure and customize the CoE “Monitor” dashboards and analytics to track usage metrics—such as app and flow activity, connector calls, and environment health—and implement baseline data loss prevention policies to enforce corporate compliance.

- **Action through Automation**: In this hands-on lab, participants will gain hands‑on experience automating Power Platform environment requests by building a Microsoft Form–based submission process and configuring a Power Automate approval flow to provision new environments and Dataverse databases upon admin approval. They will also explore the CoE Starter Kit’s auditing and user‑onboarding components to enforce governance and welcome new app makers into approved environments.

- **Managed Environments**: In this hands-on lab, participants will gain hands-on experience applying governance controls using Managed Environments and deploying solutions across environments using Power Platform Pipelines, enabling structured Dev > Test > Prod app lifecycle management.

- **Power Apps in Teams**: In this hands-on lab, participants will learn how to create a team in Microsoft Teams and build a Power App within it, gaining experience in app creation, publishing, and sharing for broader organizational use.

- **Dataverse for Teams (Optional)**: In this hands-on lab, participants will create a Power App within a Microsoft Team, publish it for team use, and share it with users outside the team to understand broad distribution capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the Power Platform admin center and Microsoft Teams.
- Basic understanding of Power Apps, Power Automate, and Microsoft Dataverse.
- General knowledge of environment management, data governance, and DLP (Data Loss Prevention) policies.
