#### Hands-on lab

## Lab Scenario

In this hands-on lab, you are an administrator, helping to adopt the Power Platform.

Contoso has decided to control creation of Power Platform environments by disabling creation unless you are a global or service admin. Contoso doesn’t want to discourage use of the Power 
Platform so they would like you to put an automated process in place to allow users to request an environment and a Microsoft Dataverse database.

In this lab, you will be building a Microsoft Form to allow users to submit their environment requests. Using the Power Platform administrative connectors and the built-in approval 
capabilities of Power Automate you will automate the processing of the requests.

The following is an outline of the process you will be implementing:

- A user submits request via the form including justification for the environment.
- Form submission triggers flow to run.
- Flow uses the approval connector to ask admin team for approval.
- If approved, the environment and Dataverse database are created.
- User is notified of the outcome; approved or rejected.

This process could easily be expanded to request approval from the user’s manager as well as the request information along with the environment information could be stored for resource 
usage charge back.

Contoso has also decided to use the app auditing process from the CoE Starter Kit. You will be seeing how this works by going through the process as both a maker and an admin.

Additionally, you will be installing a pre-created flow that checks for new people building apps and adds them to an Office 365 group and sends them a welcome email.


## Lab Test Environment

This hands-on lab is designed to be completed in an environment setup for multiple students to complete the Admin in a day series of hands-on labs.

You will be assigned one or more users to use to complete the hands-on tasks. Because this is a shared environment, some tasks that require a tenant Global Administrator or a Service 
Administrator will already be performed.

This lab does not require you to have completed any of the prior labs.

## Exercise 1: Create Environment Request Form

### Scenario

In this exercise, you will be creating an environment request form using Microsoft Forms. This form could
collect additional information allowing it to be tailored to your individual organization requirements.

### Task 1 : Create Microsoft Form

1. While logged in as the lab admin user navigate to **Microsoft Forms** and close the welcome screen.

13. Select **Preview**.

    ![](images/M03/M3-EX1-T1-S13.png)


## Exercise 2: Create Environment on Form Submit

### Scenario

In this exercise, you will be building the automated flow to process new form submissions.

Note: for the purposes of this exercise, we have hard-coded the language, currency and environment template. The Power Platform Administration connector has actions allowing you to 
dynamically retrieve these and make the process more flexible. In fact, you could allow the user to specify the values, or infer them from the user’s Office 365 profile information using 
the Office 365 connector.

### Task 1: Delete your sandbox environment

1. While logged in as the lab admin user navigate to the Power Platform admin center.

2. Locate and select your sandbox environment that you created in module one named **My Sandbox-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />** in the list of environments.

3. Select the Delete button and confirm the deletion by typing the environment name. We have to delete it in order to create another Trial environment, which we can only have one of at 
   a time.

   ![](images/M03/M3-EX2-T1-S3.png)

### Task 2 : Create New Environment Approval Flow

1. Log in with your **Lab Admin** user, navigate to **Power Automate** , and login with your admin user.

2. Confirm that your environment is set to **Power Platform CoE.**

   Note: This environment is where our CoE starter kit is installed and is intended to be our dedicated admin environment. Even if you don’t use the starter kit, having a dedicated 
   admin environment can be helpful.

## CoE Environment Management Sample Implementation

#### The CoE starter kit includes a sample implementation of an environment management process you can tailor to your own needs. The following diagram illustrates the high-level process.

![](images/M03/M3-EX3-overview.png)

##### You can learn more about the details in How to use the Environment Management components - Power Platform | Microsoft Docs

##### Using the starter kit process can save you time, but as you saw in Exercise 1 and 2 the platform also supports you building your own custom processes.


## Exercise 3: Application Compliance Process

In this exercise, you will be walking through the application compliance process that has been put in place using the CoE Starter Kit. As part of this you will be playing both the role of 
the application developer and the administrator seeing both sides of the process.

The goal of this process is to help IT that doesn't know what all these apps are intended for or how to support individual apps when the helpdesk is called, and it's unclear whether all 
the apps are being maintained to any standard. They can see details like the description and number of shared users from the Power Apps for Admins connector, but they need to communicate 
directly with the app owner to fully understand the situation around the apps. Especially in a large organization, it's not feasible for the IT team to be responsible for manually 
reaching out to each app owner individually, and those details can't be stored in email conversations.

To automate this, a flow **Admin | Compliance Detail Request** is used to iterate through all the apps in the tenant and check whether the apps are compliant. If the owner hasn't 
submitted a business justification and the app was shared broadly (in this example, with more than 20 users or at least one group), the flow sends the owner an email to notify them that 
their specific app isn't in compliance with policy. The email contains a link to the Developer Compliance Center canvas app, where the owner can provide the business justification details 
in a form submission. The Developer Compliance Center app also contains details about the compliance thresholds and has links to the app settings, so the owner can configure the 
description and republish if needed.

This app auditing sample process showcases how your CoE department or IT administrators can automate an auditing process on an app-level basis to gather additional information about an 
app, like business justification and the impact of an outage, from the maker.

### Task 1: Complete Developer Compliance

In this task you will be performing the role of the developer and completing the application information that will be requested by the automated process.

1. When the full process runs the maker will receive an email like the following, with a link to the Developer Compliance Center. For our exercise, we will briefly review and then we will 
   launch the app from the maker portal.
