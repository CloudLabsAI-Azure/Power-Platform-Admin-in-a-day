## Admin in a day

# M06-Explore the CoE Starter Kit (Optional)

### Estimated Duration: 75 Minutes

## Lab Scenario
In this lab, you will explore the Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit—a powerful toolkit that helps you manage, govern, and nurture Power Platform adoption within your organization. You’ll learn how to leverage insights from the CoE dashboard, track connector usage, review audit logs, and apply compliance processes to applications.

By the end of this lab, you will gain practical experience in using the CoE Starter Kit to support effective governance and make informed decisions regarding app usage and security.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercises:

- Exercise 1 - Explore the CoE Starter Kit
- Exercise 2 - How much is a connector used in your
- Exercise 3 - Review tenant audit logs 
- Exercise 4 - Application Compliance Process

**Note:** All these exercises depend on the successful setup of the Inventory component of the CoE Starter Kit, which you completed in a previous exercise. Once the setup is complete, it may take approximately 3–4 hours for the data to be fully reflected in both the Power Platform and Power BI.

You may proceed with the exercises if the data has loaded successfully. If not, you'll need to wait until the data becomes available. In the meantime, you can review the exercises to familiarize yourself with the lab content.

## Exercise 1: Explore the CoE Starter Kit

In this exercise, you will explore some of the apps and analytics that are part of the Power Platform CoE Starter Kit. We have already installed and configured the starter kit for the 
tenant you are using for this lab. As part of configuring, we imported the solution, shared the apps, configured the flows that synchronize data and published the Power BI report. If you 
were doing this with your tenant, you would follow the instructions to complete these steps.

Now in this exercise, you will explore the following key components:

- Power Platform Admin View app
- Power BI Dashboard
- The business process that is used by the Developer Compliance process.

### Task 1: Explore the Power Platform Admin View app

## Exercise 3: Review tenant audit logs 

### Scenario

All other auditing of Power Apps and Power Automate flows (other than CDS data modification) are viewed through the Microsoft Purview site.

Before use, this must be enabled by a global tenant administrator using these instructions. In the tenant you are using we have already completed that for you as well as permitting you to view the audit log data for the tenant. That was done using the PowerShell command Add-RoleGroupMember “Compliance Management” -Member your user.

In this exercise, you will be using the log search and alert tools to work with the audit data.

### Task 1: Review audit logging in the environment

1. Navigate to **Microsoft purview** using the following link https://purview.microsoft.com/.

1. Click on **Get Started**.

   ![](images/M02/ppt23.png)

1. Select **Solution (1)** and then choose **Audit (2)** on the left side navigation.

   ![](images/M02/ppt24.png)

1. Click on the **Start recording user and admin activity**.

1. Select **Search** using the default search criteria.

   ![](images/M2-EX6-T1-S3.png)

1. The **Job Status** will read as **Queued** once it has been set to process. **Refresh** the audit every few minutes or so until the status reads as **Completed**.

   ![](images/M2-EX6-T1-S5.png)

1. Select the Search name, which defaults to the audit date if no name has been inputted.

   ![](images/M2-EX6-T1-S6.png)

    >**Note**: Portal will be updating your organization to support customization. So it might take around 24 to 48 hours to show the data and activities.

     ![](images/M02/ppt26.png)    

1. Please go through the steps, no need to perform as currently there is no data available.     

1. Review the items displayed; drill into a few of them to see the type of data available.

   ![](images/M2-EX6-T1-S7.png)

1. Select **Export** if you’d like to download the data for later viewing. Using export, you can open the data in other tools for analysis.

   ![](images/M02/M2-EX6-T1-S8.png)

1. The export will begin and may take some time to complete.

    ![](images/M02/M2-EX6-T1-S9.png)

1. Select **Audit search** breadcrumb at the top of the page to navigate back to the search. This will not interrupt the export.

    ![](images/M2-EX6-T1-S10.png)

1. Select the **Activities** dropdown and select all Power Apps and Power Automate activities.

    ![](images/M2-EX6-T1-S11.png)

1. Select **Search** again and review the results once the status is Completed.

1. Look for an activity of Edited Flow, and select the item to open the detail. Review what data is provided.

1. A common task is to look at all of the activity for a particular user. Copy the user from this Edited flow activity and go back to the Audit search.

1. Paste the user you copied into the Users filter and select search again. Now you are looking at all the activity for a single user.

1. Try selecting an item to view detail. Copy the Item field and then go back to the list and select the filter results. Paste the item info you just copied into the file. The results list will now only show activities related to that item. For example, you could use this to show all activities for a specific flow.

>**Note:** Any information from before auditing was enabled, cannot be retrieved. This can be seen by selecting a date range from before the auditing was enabled.

## Exercise 4: Application Compliance Process (Read Only)

In this exercise, you will be walking through the application compliance process that has been put in place using the CoE Starter Kit. As part of this, you will be playing both the role of 
the application developer and the administrator see both sides of the process.

The goal of this process is to help IT that doesn't know what all these apps are intended for or how to support individual apps when the helpdesk is called, and it's unclear whether all 
the apps are being maintained to any standard. They can see details like the description and number of shared users from the Power Apps for Admins connector, but they need to communicate 
directly with the app owner to fully understand the situation around the apps. Especially in a large organization, it's not feasible for the IT team to be responsible for manually 
reaching out to each app owner individually, and those details can't be stored in email conversations.

To automate this, a flow **Admin | Compliance Detail Request** is used to iterate through all the apps in the tenant and check whether the apps are compliant. If the owner hasn't 
submitted a business justification and the app was shared broadly (in this example, with more than 20 users or at least one group), the flow sends the owner an email to notify them that 
their specific app isn't in compliance with the policy. The email contains a link to the Developer Compliance Center canvas app, where the owner can provide the business justification details 
in a form submission. The Developer Compliance Center app also contains details about the compliance thresholds and has links to the app settings, so the owner can configure the 
description and republish if needed.

This app auditing sample process showcases how your CoE department or IT administrators can automate an auditing process on an app-level basis to gather additional information about an 
app, like business justification and the impact of an outage, from the maker.

### Task 1: Setup compliance process
In this task, you will be setting up the compliance process for the Governance Components application that you installed in the previous lab.

1. Now return to the tab where your **Center of Excellence - Core Components** solution is open.

1. Open the CoE Setup and Upgrade Wizard app. Click **Apps** **(1)**, Click the three ellipses (⋯) next to the **CoE Setup and Upgrade Wizard** **(2)**. Select **Play** **(3)** to launch the app.

    ![](images/M02/pv22.png)

1. Navigate to the **More features** page and select **Configure the feature** in **Compliance process**.

    ![](images/M02/M2-EX3N-T1-S15.png)

    > **Note:** The app will guide you through the setup process. If it indicates that some processes are running in the background, it means backend flows are still in progress. You will see the 'Get Started' screen only after all flows have successfully completed.

1. Click **Refresh**. If a pop-up appears regarding flow configuration, proceed as prompted.

1. On the **Get Started** screen, click **Next**.

1. On the **Exempt environments from this process** screen, click **Next**.  
    ![](images/M02/M2-EX3N-T1-S16.png)
